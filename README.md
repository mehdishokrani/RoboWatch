# RoboWatch

My Arduino-based robot is high performance, with a number of sensors and modules to perform a variety of functions. The robot's two ultrasonic sensors identify items and obstacles within a specific range, while the motion sensor detects movement and triggers the robot's response. The sound and light sensors provide additional environmental feedback, and the temperature sensor can assist in detecting temperature changes that could indicate a fire or other hazard.

The four DC motors on the robot provide for a variety of mobility possibilities, while the camera and WiFi module allow for remote monitoring and control. The RGB LEDs and buzzer enable the robot to offer visible and audio notifications to residents or rescue professionals to warn them of potential threats.

Overall, I believe that my robot has the potential to be a useful tool in both home security and rescue missions. In the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster, the robot might be used to help discover and rescue people who are trapped or in danger. Similarly, in the context of home security, the robot may be used to monitor and protect a home, alerting homeowners to potential break-ins or other security risks.
